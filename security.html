            <p class="text-center">BITCOIN CAN PROVIDE VERY HIGH LEVELS OF SECURITY WHEN USED CORRECTLY.
                ALWAYS REMEMBER IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO APPLY BEST PRACTICES WHEN SECURING YOUR FUNDS</p>
            <p class="text-center"><b>Important:</b> The main thing to understand about digital currencies like Bitcoin is
                that you are the bank and you are in charge of your funds.
                Keeping safe is easy when you know how but like cash in your pocket, it’s entirely up
                to you how safe or unsafe you wish to be.</p>

            <h4>Here are some simple steps to maintain responsibility for your storage:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Anti-virus software</b></li>
                <p>Always keep your anti-virus software up to date and perform regular scans for issues that could
                    undermine your safety. Trojans and keyloggers, for instance, can steal passwords and then gain
                    access to your info whether it be financial or personal. Keep the wolves outside and away from
                    your important information. We really can’t stress enough how important information security hygiene
                    is when operating in the modern world.</p>
                <p>We use programs like ‘Spybot Search and Destroy’, ‘Malware Anti-bytes’ and ‘Microsoft Security Essentials’.
                    If think you know something we don’t then let us know. The stronger the community the more secure we all are.</p>
                <li><b>Bullet-proof passwords</b></li>
                <p>Strong passwords or phrases are absolutely paramount for the defence of your online information.
                    Many people underestimate the importance of looking after their personal things online.
                    “Don’t put anything online that you wouldn’t put on the side of a bus” usually gets some attention.
                    “Well at least not without a bullet-proof password”.
                    There are a few approaches to a good password. We recommend using Letters (upper and lower case),
                    Numbers and Punctuation e.g. ~#&£$ etc. Or Mnemonic Phrases which are selections of random words
                    e.g. “abstract gaming latitude wiring foxes” which can be easier to remember than “GDSbsatj??#;T6278-7654321$tars”
                <p>There are a few different ways to a very strong password and some websites are listed below.
                    Whatever you decide, it’s important to remember that a password like “GoBitcoin100K” can be hacked
                    by a regular pc computer with the right program in less than 1 second.
                    A 30-digit password like the one above could take trillions of years.</p>
                <li><b>Cold storage</b></li>
                <p>If you intend to store coins for a period of time, as an investment or perhaps you just have lots of coins you would
                    like as secure as possible then you should consider cold-wallet storage. There are varying degrees of quality when
                    cold-storing which all come down to how you set up the wallet online. Because all wallets are set up on a computer,
                    if you want to make certain your computer is free from prying eyes then extra steps must be taken, which involve some
                    logical steps that aren’t rocket science but will take some thinking about.</p>

                <li><b>Defend with 2-Factor Authentication</b></li>
                <p>Even with the best password in the universe, if a hacker does get into your computer, they can just take it.
                    Don’t worry though, there is another line of defence. 2-Factor Authentication or 2FA for short.
                    This is really simple and really effective.  2FA is an app on your smartphone which gives you a
                    6-digit number when you want to log into one of your accounts. Simply, if someone steals your password
                    online they still need your phone to gain access.  You can use this for loads of accounts from email accounts
                    to Bitcoin wallets. Also the 2FA code changes every 30 seconds,
                    so even you won’t know what it is until you need it.</p>
                <p>To set this up go to your app store on your smartphone and download the Google Authenticator or Authy app,
                    then follow the instructions in the app and on the website you want to use it with. When you log into your
                    email address or online blockchain.info wallet, after you enter your password, you will then be prompted to
                    enter your 2FA code which comes from the app on your phone.
                    It’s also a good idea to take a screen shot or a good photo of the QR code for each site you set up 2FA with,
                    just in case you lose your phone and need to set it up on a new phone (if you do use a photo, remember to save
                    the picture on a hard drive or email it to yourself, don’t keep it on your phone because you might lose it and
                    that’s the whole point) When you get a replacement phone you can set up the QR codes without having to log into
                    your accounts.  Obviously you need to make sure your screen shots and photos are secure too.</p>
                <p><b>Note:</b> To take a screen shot at any time of what’s on your computer screen, hold ctrl and, press prtsc,
                    which is the button located above delete and insert, and to the right of F12 on the keyboard (on an ordinary
                    microsoft keyboard).  Then open Microsoft paint and just, ctrl v, to paste the picture - then you can save it.</p>
                <li><b>Electronic cash</b></li>
                <p>Treat your Bitcoin balance like you treat your bank balance or regular wallet or purse.
                    It’s not something you want to go blabbing about.  Don’t go telling people your wallet address without good reason.
                    It’s also good to generate new addresses often, remember that the balance of your address can be seen by anyone on
                    the blockchain website if they know what your address is (keep moving).  Don’t go around telling people you’re
                    bank account details without good reason, same for Bitcoin.</p>
