            <h2>Bitcoins Wallets</h2>
            <p>A wallet will give you access to your funds.
                Each wallet has an address that’s made up of 24 numbers and letters.
                Like a bank’s 8 digit account number and 6 digit sort-code, except with letters too.</p>
            <p class="text-center">Bitcoin wallet address and QR code: e.g. 25qqLNToRvHJcvyET3hsDi9XV11T25Cn5p</p>
            <img class="center-block" src="img/QR.jpg" alt="QR image for a wallet">
            <br>
            <p>This address is how you know where your coins are and your wallet allows you to make transactions.</p>
            <p>Your address is the only one like it in the world and the basics are this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You have a public key (this is your address, where your funds are stored on the blockchain) &</li>
                <li>You have a private key (your password which unlocks the door to your address)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>When sending/receiving transactions or paying for stuff you want to buy,
                just enter the amount you want to pay then scan the QR code or address of the person/business
                you want to transfer funds to, hit send and it’s done.  Simple!</p>
                <p>You can also have as many Bitcoin Wallets as you like, for free!
                    The best bit is that you don’t require proof of home address or any other pieces of personal
                    data to start a new wallet, just an email address, a computer and/or a smartphone.  Easy!
                    You could have a main wallet at home on your personal computer which could hold the majority of
                    your funds, then a mobile app or two for use on the go with enough funds for the day.
                    There are also two types of wallet depending on how you want your Bitcoins to work for you  –  ready to
                    use ‘Hot Wallets’ or ‘Cold Wallets’ that store funds in an offline manner, so you could store an offline
                    wallet for safe keeping.   There are variations of the hot and cold wallets too.
            </p>

            <h2>Hot-wallets, Cold-wallets and Multi-signature</h2>
            <p><b>All wallets perform the same task in that they give you access to your coins</b></p>
            <p><b>Hot-wallets</b> are stored online or on a computer or smartphone that is connected to the web and ready
                for transactions.  <b>Cold-wallets</b> are basically hot-wallets that have all keys deleted from the online domain.
                They’re not stored online or on your computer, instead the public and private keys are simply written down or
                printed and hidden, or stored on a USB storage device, and then all online data relating to the wallet is
                deleted/destroyed.  When you want to use your funds, the public and private keys will give you access to the
                blockchain which holds the ledger of your funds and is always ready to receive the keys and open up your funds for you.
                Cold-wallets are considered the safest option for long-term storage as you cannot hack a piece of paper or a USB stick
                stored in a safe deposit box.</p>
            <p><b>Multi-sig</b>, as it’s known, is a multi-user wallet that cannot transfer funds without the consent of two or
                more users.  Just like a multi-sig joint account from a bank.
                This can be useful for business and personal accounts.</p>
            <p>The type of wallet covered in the ‘How to set up a Bitcoin wallet’ section is from <a class="linkGrow" href="http://www.blockchain.info">blockchain.info</a>
                and is known as an online Hot-Wallet, and is almost like a more secure, bank version of Dropbox.</p>

            <p>This section is designed to show you a basic online wallet set-up.
                There are 3 basic things you need to do before you’re ready to start using an online wallet.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Protect your computer from online threats.</li>
                <li>Start a new email address.</li>
                <li>Secure your email account with 2 Factor Authentication (2FA).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The <b>First</b> thing you need to do is ensure that your computer is fully protected from viruses, spyware etc.
                exactly as a bank would expect you to. <b>Secondly</b>, is a new email address to be used, only for wallet related
                emails (it’s not essential, but it is best practise).
                This will help to increase your security as it will mean that your email address stays on the down-low,
                as opposed to using an email that all your friends, contacts, Facebook and other companies
                know about (keep it secret).  <b>Thirdly</b>, get 2 Factor Authentication (2FA for short) set up on your email account.
                This is a really simple app that gives you another level of security access to your email after your password has
                been entered (for really easy instructions on 2FA and the importance of password choice check out the security section)
            </p>

            <h3>Where to get your wallet</h3>
            <p>The most straight forward choice is a wallet from <a class="linkGrow" href="https://blockchain.info">blockchain.info</a>
                these guys will store your wallets data (encrypted) but you will hold the passes to decode your data.
                From there you can set up an online wallet on your home computer and, also download Android and IOS smartphone
                apps for mobile wallets. Once on their website follow their instructions; enter your email address,
                a strong password/phrase – remember to set up 2FA - and you’re almost good to go.</p>

            <h3>Keep your wallet safe and secure</h3>
            <p>If you have followed the instructions on the blockchain.info website correctly, you should have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A strong password of your choosing</li>
                <li>Taken note of the identifier you are given which is like a username
                    Example: c70e084a-b0bc-52cd-96e4-52e7b4cd6cdc - <b>THIS IS NOT YOUR WALLET ADDRESS</b>
                </li>
                <li>Taken note of your Mnemonic Passphrase (that’s the one with the sequence of 22 random words)
                    This is like a backup password you will need to gain access to your wallet in case you forget
                    your normal password, store this somewhere safe (you will need the identifier and the mnemonic
                    phrase to retrieve your password).</li>
                <li>Set up 2FA with back-up picture of the QR code in case your lose you phone.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-center text-warning"><b>Warning:</b> If you lose your <b>Keys</b> you lose <b>Access</b> to your wallet.</p>
